# Overview

![bushido.guide](./docs/assets/main.png)

In the era of information, there is abundant information spread out in the cyberspace and we spend some of our precious time, filtering that one. [bushido.guide](https://bushido.guide) was created with a clear aim: Separate the valuable content from noise.

As a result of that, there is an `explorer` which splits different rabbit holes that are to empower the individual skills and liberty but there is a specific one to learn and touch __THE__ pseudonymous digital cash

Once you fall down through the rabbit holes, it would be time to start using the digital cash freely in different places without the permission of any third party. For that there is a `market` which you can see the different p2p offers created in different decentralise exchanges. You cannot buy directly there but you can make an idea what kind of offers are in different markets

### Run the app
This is an app that needs to be feed with data, if not it does not work. You will need to set up, bushido.library, bushido.backend and bushido.market which lives in @tipogi repository.
But if you want to feed with your own data, just install the modules and run the application
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
