In the era of information, there is abundant information spread out in the cyberspace and we spend some of our precious time, filtering that one. bushido.guide was created with a clear aim: Separate the valuable content from noise.

As a result of that, there is an explorer which splits different rabbit holes that are to empower the individual skills and liberty but there is a specific one to learn and touch __THE__ pseudonymous digital cash

Once you fall down through the rabbit holes, it would be time to start using the digital cash freely in different places without the permission of any third party. For that there is a market which you can see the different p2p offers created in different decentralise exchanges. You cannot buy directly there but you can make an idea what kind of offers are in different markets
